# backyard.io
This is our bid to make food available for all, we implore our very old backyard farming 
but this time in a mechanised way because _We Clearly Live In Busy World_.


## How it works
backyard.io is made up of three entities;
* Web Application -
* Mobile Application - Here, the various hardware components can be controlled.
* The `CORE` - Raspberry Pi that gets the physical from the crops and back to the cloud
